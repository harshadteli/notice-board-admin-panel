# üèõÔ∏è BCS Department Notice Board Management Panel

This is a faculty-facing web application designed to manage and publish notices directly to a Google Sheet, which can then be displayed on a public-facing student notice board (or another client application). The system is built using vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend and Google Apps Script as a serverless backend.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Faculty Login:** Secure login using hardcoded or Google Sheet-based credentials (demonstrated using hardcoded check in the final JS).
* **Session Management:** Uses browser `localStorage` to maintain the login session.
* **CRUD Operations:**
    * **Create:** Add new notices with detailed fields (Title, Content, Teacher, Subject, Division, Year).
    * **Read:** Fetch and display all current notices with a "Latest First" view.
    * **Delete:** Remove existing notices directly from the management panel.
* **Responsive UI:** Fully responsive design ensures the management panel and the Add Notice modal look great on desktop and mobile devices.
* **Modal Form:** Clean, dedicated modal/popup for adding new notices, improving user focus.
* **Data Integrity:** Uses `<select>` dropdowns for Division and BCS Year to ensure consistent data input.
* **Loading Feedback:** Integrated loading spinner for seamless user experience during network operations (login, add, delete, fetch).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Backend:** Google Apps Script (GAS)
* **Database:** Cloud Server
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
